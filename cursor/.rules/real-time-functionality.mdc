Build the real-time chat feature:
- React components: ChatWindow, MessageList, MessageInput
- Connect to Flask-SocketIO backend to send/receive messages instantly
- On backend, handle Socket.IO events for 'send_message' and broadcast to channel subscribers
- Persist all messages with metadata (user_id, channel_id, timestamp) in MongoDB
- Allow joining/leaving channels with appropriate socket rooms
