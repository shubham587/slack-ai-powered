- Axios for REST API calls
- Styling with Tailwind CSS (or any preferred CSS framework)

Backend:
- Flask web framework in Python
- Flask-SocketIO for WebSocket support and real-time events
- PyMongo for MongoDB interactions
- OpenAI Python SDK to interact with GPT and embedding APIs
- Vector search with FAISS or Chroma for semantic search of messages and docs
- MongoDB for storing users, messages, channels, threads, and pinned documents
- Background job processing (optional) for async embedding generation

The app supports real-time messaging, AI-driven organization-wide memory, auto-reply suggestions, tone analysis, and meeting notes generation.
